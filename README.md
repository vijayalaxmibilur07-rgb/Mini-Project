# Mini-Project
"Developed a Python-based transfer learning model to classify listening environments for hearing-impaired users. Used pre-trained networks, MFCCs, spectrograms, and Librosa to process real audio. Built an end-to-end ML pipeline and enhanced environment recognition for assistive hearing tech."
